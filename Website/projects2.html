    I made two video games for my Game Design and Development: Programming and Practice course during the fall of my
    junior year.
    <br>
    The course included visits to Crytek headquarters, DokkX, DE:HIVE, and developer presentations in
    Aarhus, Denmark and Berlin, Germany.
    <br>
    These video games were made in the Unity game engine and scripting was done in C#. They were made in groups of
    three to five people, which required extensive knowledge of and collaboration in Git.

<p>
    Failed Musician Escape Room is a virtual escape room about a musician who needs to get his life together and
    write some music. The player completes several puzzles with the end goal of writing a song. It was made in four
    weeks. My contributions:
<ul>
    <li>Interaction mechanics (press E to open, close, etc.)</li>
    <li>Pick up/carry objects mechanics</li>
    <li>Sound Design</li>
    <li>Start menu and pause menu</li>
    <li>TV puzzle + ad creation</li>
    <li>Sheet music</li>
    <li>Apartment design</li>
    <li>Props</li>
</ul>
<br>
Note: the game is not designed for web, and as such there are several minor glitches that occur when playing through
itch.io (mouse cursor leaves the game even when in fullscreen, quit button freezes the game). For the best
experience, download the build linked in my <a href="https://github.com/imvahn/GameDesignFinal2023" class="underline"
