      <h1>Five Chess Visualizations</h1>
      <p>
        In February of this year, my roommate insisted that I download the chess.com app and play him in chess. And
        ever
        since, I've been hooked. My problem is that I'm terrible at chess. And it's largely because I've refused to
        learn any chess theory or strategies. Why? Because I'm stubborn. I'm no prodigy—not even close—but I figured
        if
        eight-year-olds can make it to world chess championships, my college brain and crippling chess.com app
        addiction
        should be just enough to improve somewhat over a few months.
        <br><br>
        I was wrong. It is months later and I am still unbelievably bad at chess. However, my ego-fueled and naïve
        approach to playing chess has one benefit: I'm the perfect control group! Who else would play chess for hours
        a
        week and months on end without attempting to learn anything? I am as far removed as one can be from the best
        chess players in the world while still having a comprehensive understanding of the game. <b>In this project, I
          attempt to analyze my chess games fom February to April 2023 through several different factors such as move
          count, board position, and elo.</b> These
        factors will be explained in greater depth throughout the visualizations. I also analyze every game played in
        three different time classes: bullet, blitz, and rapid. A time class indicates the amount of time allotted to
        each player in a game. The time for each respective player counts down when it is their turn, and pauses when
        it
        is their opponent's turn. Bullet games allot 1-2 minutes for each player, blitz games allot 3-5 minutes for
        each
        player, and rapid games allot 5-15 minutes for each player. This results in 4 minute, 10 minute, and 30 minute
        games. The time class has a significant impact on one's gameplay. Less time on the clock means less time to
        think of potential moves and how the opponent will respond, and more opportunities for mistakes and irregular
        outcomes. Because move accuracy can be so different in the different time classes, it is both necessary and
        entertaining to compare games based on their time class. It is worth noting that the majority of my games
        played
        on chess.com are blitz games, so the data of my blitz games is the least susceptible to outliers.
        <br><br>
        <b>A crucial part of my analysis is how my games compares to games played by
          Hikaru Nakamura, an American chess grandmaster and world champion in several tournaments.</b> One of the
        most
        striking aspects of his gameplay is how accurate he is. In chess, accuracy refers to how closely a player
        compares to a chess engine, a machine-learning program that determines the 'best' move options. Hikaru
        averages
        80% to 90% accuracy in his games, with a significant portion in the 95%-99% range. This is staggering. It
        means
        that he is choosing almost exclusively perfect moves in every game. Hikaru's gameplay is as close to a
        computer
        as possible. Thus, by comparing my games with Hikaru's, I am comparing two extremes. <b>How does untrained,
          naïve
          gameplay compare to some of the most statistically accurate gameplay in the world?</b> Just how bad am I? In
        these
        past three months, have I improved at all? We'll see what my analysis yields.

            This first visualization focuses on the number of moves in games played by myself and Hikaru. There
            is a
            lot
            of information that can be revealed by the
            number of moves in a game. Every chess game has three stages: an opening, a
            midgame, and an endgame. The opening can last up to 20 moves, but as few as
            10. The midgame doesn't really have a set move amount because the endgame begins
            once most pieces have been removed from the board, which can happen after
            30 moves, 60 moves, or even after 120 moves. Keeping this in mind, the number
            of moves in a game tells a story of how the game plays out. A game with a short
            number of moves means that it ended quickly and decisively; this could be from a
            gap appearing in a player's defenses that was taken advantage of. By the midgame, the board could be in
            one of nearly infinite
            positions, so games that end in the midgame are often the result of a carefully prepared attack. By the
            endgame, nearly every piece has been removed from the board. Players rely on specific endgame tactics
            and strategies to account for this lack of pieces. The number of moves in a game can indicate
            substantially different outcomes.
            When accounting for time classes, especially games that only give each player
            1-2 total minutes, many games can end simply because a player runs out of time,
            not because they got checkmated.
            <br><br>
            <b>This visualization looks at the distribution of moves in games that I won
              and in games that Hikaru won. The distribution accounts for the color of
              Hikaru's and my pieces. Because white goes first, the player who plays white
              always has a slight advantage. This becomes evident in the visualization.</b>
            <br><br>
            Across all the time classes, I won more games in fewer moves as white than as
            black. This makes sense because of white's first-move advantage. As a chess
            game continues, the advantage from starting as white becomes less and less
            impactful. This statement is supported through looking at my bullet games.
            Because games are so quick, white's advantage is maximized. It makes sense
            that the majority of my bullet games as white are won in a very small number
            of moves. Interestingly, my bullet move distribution is tri-modal for both
            black and white. The high density of wins at ~50 and ~70 moves in bullet
            tells its own story: by the time the game has reached that many moves, players
            have only a few seconds left on their clock. This means that wins are determined
            by who can stall longer, forcing their opponent out of time. In bullet games,
            white's wins are determined by how effectively they can attack, whereas black's
            wins are determined by how effectively they defend.
            <br><br>
            Hikaru's data is less irregular than mine. The distributions of the number of
            moves in Hikaru's games are pretty consistent between colors. In general, his
            games are won regardless of starting color. This makes sense, because his
            gameplay is essentially perfect. When you're making the most accurate moves,
            starting advantages don't have much of an impact. That's part of the beauty of
            chess: handicaps imposed by the mechanics of the game can be overcome by pure
            skill. This also explains why the distributions of the number of moves are
            more similar in longer time classes. With more time to think, one has more time
            to come up with the best move. And, as Hikaru demonstrates, starting advantages
            can be overcome with accurate gameplay.
            <br><br>
            Why are my distributions so much less consistent and so much funkier-looking
            than Hikaru's? Well, put simply, I'm much much much much much much worse. My games are determined more
            by
            luck than skill. It makes sense that my
            distributions are irregular, because my gameplay is irregular!

            <b>This visualization looks at game outcomes (win, loss, or draw) to find out how the number of moves in a
              game changes depending on how the game ends.</b>
            <br><br>
            These distributions are very interesting. First, it's worth noting that games
            ending in a draw have a much lower density than those ending in a win or a loss.
            This makes sense, because most games are won or lost, not drawn.
            <br><br>
            The distributions of the number of moves in my blitz games point out a flaw in my
            capabilities as a player. Most of my drawn games happened at ~75 moves, while
            my won and lost games happened at ~20. This indicates that I struggle heavily
            in endgame positions. In the endgame, when there are fewer pieces on the board,
            it is much easier to draw a game. There are multiple reasons why this is the
            case:
            <br><br>
            1. The fifty move rule.
            <br>
            This rule states that "a player can claim a draw if no
            capture has been made and no pawn has been moved in the last fifty moves."
            During the endgame, it is entirely possible that there are no pawns left on the
            board, eliminating the second clause of the rule. It is also easier to dodge
            capture, because there is more space on the board to move. Without any pieces in
            the way, players can run across the board, dodging attacks. It is harder to get
            pinned or trapped in one spot and captured. Because I am not good in endgame
            positions, I often struggle to effectively capture pieces before fifty moves
            have passed.
            <br><br>
            2. Stalemate.
            <br>
            A stalemate occurs when a player cannot move any more pieces.
            <br><br>
            3. Time.
            <br>
            In bullet and blitz games, time is a crucial factor. By the time
            players have reached the endgame, there are seconds left on the clock. This
            leaves more opportunities for mistakes. When I am low on time, my thoughts
            change from "how do I win" to "how do I not run out of time first." This
            gives my opponent an opportunity to stall with the fifty move rule. It
            also means that I'm putting less thought into my moves. Less thought means
            more mistakes, such as an accidental stalemate or a failure to capture a piece
            in fifty moves.
            <br><br>
            Hikaru's draws, by comparison, happen at around the same number of moves as his
            wins and losses. This is because he is much better than me. Chess grandmasters
            operate on a different plane of existence: they have played so many games and
            have had so much practice that they can predict tens of moves in advance. Thus,
            time is not nearly as much of an issue for Hikaru as it is for me. However,
            Hikaru's blitz distribution is slightly bimodal, with the second hump at ~125
            moves. Chess.com matches players by their skill level. In Hikaru's case, he
            is playing individuals who are experts at stalling and dodging his attacks.
            Thus, he can fall victim to the fifty move rule or to a stalemate, or, in rare
            cases, by running out of time. These occurences are rare, though, which is why
            the second hump is barely visible. Hikaru's bullet distribution is significantly
            bimodal. The first hump lines up with his wins and losses, but the second one
            occurs at ~75 moves. Because bullet games are half the length as blitz games,
            time is a much more consequential factor—there are more opportunities to mess up.
            <br><br>
            The distribution of the number of moves in my won bullet games is trimodal,
            which, although weird, makes sense given the context of the first visualization.
            The distribution of the number of moves in my rapid games is ridiculous. This
            is because I have only played 32 rapid games, with 3 draws. Thus, the 3 draws
            are very evident.

            <b>This visualization maps the amount of times pieces were moved to certain
              positions on the board. It's essentially a 'heat map' of where pieces are placed
              most often.</b> This required a gigantic amount of data manipulation, to the point
            where it literally breaks the shiny app. Because of this, I've embedded a PDF of all the visualzation
            results instead of a shiny app.
            <br><br>
            The highest density of pieces in both mine and Hikaru's games happens at the
            center of the board. This makes sense, because most chess games start by
            fighting for control over the center of the board. By "control," I mean that
            whoever is in control over the center has their pieces either on the center
            squares or attacking the center squares, preventing their opponent from
            approaching. Control of the center allows for more mobility for your pieces
            as well as easy access to all parts of the board. Other squares of importance
            are c3, f3, c6, and f6. In the beginning of a game, knights often move to those
            squares because they're the only place a knight can move without any other
            pieces having to be moved first.
            <br><br>
            In general, these heatmaps demonstrate Hikaru's mastery of board positioning.
            In the blitz games, for example, the majority concentration of my pieces is on
            the center squares and the other four squares mentioned previously. Hikaru's
            blitz heatmap, on the other hand, displays a significant concentration of
            moves in the center 6x6 grid of the board, a much larger radius. The likely
            reason why Hikaru's heatmap displays such greater mobility is because he is
            familiar with a multitude of opening possibilities. When I play chess, I
            move my knights to the c3 and f3 (or c6 and f6, depending on the color) squares,
            push my center pawns forward, and proceed from there. I almost exclusively do
            this every game because I am most comfortable playing this way. My inexperience
            in chess means I don't know how to react to attacks if my knights and pawns
            aren't in a position I'm familiar with, so I put my knights and pawns in the
            same place every game. Hikaru, on the other hand, is comfortable playing from
            many different opening positions. He may begin his games by building up from
            the left side, or the right side, or by doing something else, rather than just
            going for control of the center of the board.
            <br><br>
            My rapid games are interesting because they don't appear to follow any
            particular pattern. My rapid games as black showcase a diagonal line in the
            middle of the board, but my rapid games as white don't indicate anything like
            that. This is because I am more confident in rapid games. Because the timer is
            longer, I have more time to think about every move. I'm comfortable moving
            pieces other than my knights and center pawns because I feel like I have enough
            time to process my opponent's response and calculate the best moves. In bullet
            and blitz games, where every second counts, I'm more liable to overlooking a
            move or making a mistake when I face something I'm not used to, because I have
            less time to think about proper responses. Hikaru's rapid games also follow
            less of a pattern than his blitz or bullet games.

            <b>This visualization maps Elo in a time series from February to the end of
              April.</b> Elo is a rating system used to calculate the relative skill levels of
            players in a zero-sum game; that is to say, a game where one side losing means
            the other side wins. Every time class has its own Elo, which means that
            players can be rated differently for different modes. After playing hundreds of
            games over several months, have I improved at all? Am I better in certain time
            classes? How does Hikaru compare?
            <br><br>
            Frankly, no. I have not improved. In fact, I think I've gotten worse. My
            blitz and bullet ratings are at around 300 Elo (and decreasing), which puts me in
            the 15th percentile of players. That means that I am worse than 85% of players
            on the chess.com website. My rapid rating is a little higher, at 600 Elo, placing
            me at around the 45th percentile. For a player like me who does not know any
            chess theory, every game requires me to analyze the board at every position. I
            don't have an encyclopedia of openings memorized, nor do I know any strategies.
            My skill in chess is completely dependent on the amount of time I have to think
            of a move. Hikaru's rating has remained pretty consistent over the months, at
            around 3300 Elo in bullet and blitz and 2800 Elo in rapid. While Hikaru hasn't
            "improved" in the sense that his Elo hasn't increased, he has remained #2 in
            the world in blitz and bullet and #6 in the world in rapid for several months,
            an impossibly impressive feat.
            <br><br>
            When I made a chess.com account, I foolishly selected "intermediate" for my
            skill level. That started me off with 1200 Elo in every time class which, as is
            evident, decreased substantially and rapidly. In conclusion, I need to study.

            Chess is one of the oldest and most played games in the world, and has been
            played on every continent on the planet. Unlike sports, which can be
            inaccessible to many depending on the location, the cost of gear,
            and how many friends are available, chess can be
            played by anyone anywhere. Thus, it has had large international impact, with
            chess masters originating from countries around the globe. <b>In this visualization I wanted to see how
              great
              players are represented
              internationally.</b>
            <br><br>
            While the United States definitely hosts a majority of top players, masters
            can be seen across the map. Interestingly, a much greater majority of top bullet
            players live in the United States than in any other country. Fewer than five
            players per country from countries other than the United States are in the top
            50 bullet players. In blitz and rapid time classes, the amount of top players in
            Russia, China, and India jumps up to ~7 players per country. There are also
            considerably more top players from South America who play bullet than there are
            in any other time class.

        Many questions arose from my findings. I would like to know the locations of
        everyone in the world that I have played against. I would also like to know how
        that compares to the locations of players that Hikaru plays against. I wonder if
        it is different. As I play more games and actually attempt to study chess,
        I wonder how my visualizations will change. I wonder if I'll actually get better!

        I made two video games for my Game Design and Development: Programming and Practice course during the fall of
        my
        junior year.
        <br>
        These video games were made in the Unity game engine and scripting was done in C#. They were made in groups of
        three to five people, which required extensive knowledge of and collaboration in Git.
        <br>
        The course included visits to Crytek headquarters, DokkX, DE:HIVE, and developer presentations in
        Aarhus, Denmark and Berlin, Germany.

      <p>
        Failed Musician Escape Room is a virtual escape room about a musician who needs to get his life together and
        write some music. The player completes several puzzles with the end goal of writing a song. It was made in
        four
        weeks. My contributions:</p>
      <p>
        - Interaction mechanics (press E to open, close, etc.)<br>
        - Pick up/carry objects mechanics<br>
        - Sound design<br>
        - Start menu and pause menu<br>
        - TV puzzle + ad creation<br>
        - Sheet music<br>
        - Apartment design<br>
        - Props<br>
        <br>
        Note: the game is not designed for web, and as such there are several minor glitches that occur when playing
        through
        itch.io (mouse cursor leaves the game even when in fullscreen, quit button freezes the game). For the best
        experience, download the build linked in my <a href="https://github.com/imvahn/GameDesignFinal2023"

        Walkthrough:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Read texts from your girlfriend.<br>
        2. Pick up beer bottles in the bedroom and throw them out<br>
        3. Read "Emails to my Love" on the living room table, the highlighted music notes correspond to the computer
        password<br>
        4. Computer password: DGBCG<br>
        5. Find the remote in the kitchen drawer to the left of the oven and turn on the TV<br>
        6. Find the key in the box in the hallway and unlock the fridge<br>
        7. Open the leftmost bathroom cabinet to find the box of cigarettes<br>
        8. Fill in the missing lyrics: "Cigarettes", "guitar picks", "energy drinks", "Pookie"<br>
        9. The number of each of the four items found around the room corresponds to the numbers on the keypad next to
        the music
        room door, and the order of these numbers is determined by the order of the missing lyrics<br>
        10. Keypad code: 1824<br>
        11. Take the inspiration pills in the right drawer of the desk in the music room<br>
        12. The letters in front of the computer, TV, fridge, and bathroom cabinet are the letters of the chords that
        correspond
        to each of the four items mentioned in the song<br>
        13. Fill in the chords with their respective items in the sheet music on the piano: G, Bb, A, F

        features I've learned:</p>
      <p>
        - Languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript (duh!) as well as some SCSS and pen<br>
        - JavaScript libraries: GSAP, Prism, ScrollReveal, JQuery<br>
        - Web app hosting: ShinyApps, itch.io<br>
        <br>
        You might get a better grasp of the skills I've developed by browsing my website more ;)
